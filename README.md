The python file reads employee data from an excel sheet and applies the risk factor algorithm to come up with a rank factor for employees  based on different factors like containment zones, health of the employee, proximity to office etc.
The excel-vba application looks at the rank generated by the algorithm and generates a list of employees who are most eligible to work from office for a particular week.
